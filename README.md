## Matlab implementation of several channel coding 

Version: Matlab 2018b with Communications Toolbox 7.0 was used.

#### LDPC (Low Density Parity Check Code)

* LDPC128.m : 128 QAM, 1/2 code rate

* LDPC256.m : 256 QAM, 1/2 code rate

* LDPC1024.m : 1024 QAM, 1/2 code rate

The length of codeword is fixed at 64800 bits based on DVB-S.2 Standard. By changing different code rates in the corresponding Matlab file, we can get:
